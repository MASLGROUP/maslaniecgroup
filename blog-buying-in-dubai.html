  <h1>What Can You Really Buy in Dubai Without a License?</h1>

  <p>Dubai has strict regulations about what can be legally bought or sold ‚Äî especially when it comes to businesses or frequent trading. However, as an individual, there are still many things you can buy or sell without needing a commercial license.</p>

  <h2>‚úîÔ∏è Used Items & Personal Belongings</h2>
  <p>You‚Äôre allowed to sell second-hand goods like furniture, electronics, clothes, and household items ‚Äî especially through platforms like <strong>Dubizzle</strong>, Facebook Marketplace, or private groups. This is legal as long as it‚Äôs not regular commercial activity.</p>

  <h2>üö´ What's Not Allowed</h2>
  <p>Running a store, reselling goods regularly, or offering services like photography, tutoring, or repairs without a license is not allowed. Doing so could lead to fines or being blocked online.</p>

  <h2>üí° Tip: When in Doubt ‚Äî Ask!</h2>
  <p>If you're unsure whether your activity requires a license, it's better to check first. Authorities in Dubai take compliance seriously, and a small mistake could cost you.</p>
