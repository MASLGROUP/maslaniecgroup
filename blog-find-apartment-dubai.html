  <h1>How to Find an Apartment in Dubai</h1>

  <p>Finding the right apartment in Dubai can be exciting — but also overwhelming. With so many neighborhoods, agents, platforms, and pricing differences, it’s easy to make mistakes. Here’s what you need to know before you sign anything.</p>

  <h2>1. Choose the Right Area for Your Lifestyle</h2>
  <p>Dubai has districts for every lifestyle — Downtown, Marina, Business Bay, JVC, Damac Hills, and more. Are you looking for walkability, family areas, or luxury living? Your choice of location affects your cost, commute, and daily life.</p>

  <h2>2. Understand the Pricing (and Hidden Costs)</h2>
  <p>Rental prices are usually listed annually, but paid in 1 to 4 cheques. You’ll also need to budget for:
    <ul>
      <li>5%–10% security deposit</li>
      <li>5%–7% agency commission</li>
      <li>DEWA (electricity & water) setup</li>
      <li>Ejari registration</li>
    </ul>
    Make sure to ask your agent for a full breakdown before agreeing to anything.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Use Trusted Portals — but Watch Out</h2>
  <p>Platforms like <strong>Bayut</strong>, <strong>Property Finder</strong>, and <strong>Dubizzle</strong> are good for searching. But beware: some listings are fake, outdated, or "bait and switch" ads. Always confirm availability and meet agents in person.</p>

  <h2>4. Avoid Scams and Overpromises</h2>
  <p>Never transfer money before visiting the property and signing with a verified agent or landlord. Some scams look professional. If it sounds too good to be true — it is.</p>

  <h2>5. Ask the Right Questions</h2>
  <p>Before renting, ask about maintenance responsibility, chiller fees (AC cooling), building rules, and the owner's flexibility. It will save you time, money, and frustration later.</p>
